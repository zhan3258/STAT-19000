1.  Use the airline data stored in this directory:


/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009


1a. What was the average arrival delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?
* 7.03274
* Solution: I get into the file first, and then I put “ls” to list all the files in it. 
* Then, I put “ head 2005.csv”
* So I got the top ten data of the 2005 file.
* And I find out the 15 line is the arrival delay
* So I put cat 2005.csv | awk -F, ‘{ delay += $15 ; count +=1} END{print delay/count} ‘
* Then I got the answer


1b. What was the average departure delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?
* 8.51186
* Solution: First, get into the file
* Then put “head 2005.csv”
* So I know that the line 16 is the departure delay
* So I put cat 2005.csv | awk -F, ‘{delay += $16 ; count +=1 }END{print delay/count}’
* Then I got the answer


1cd. Now revise your solution to 1ab, to account for the full set of data, across all years.
* So if I want to get all the data for the whole year, I can put head allyears.csv
* Then for the arrive delay I need to put “cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{ delay += $15 ; count +=1} END{print delay/count}' “
* So the answer is 6.9023


* So for the departure delay, we do the same thing. And we need to put cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{ delay += $16 ; count +=1} END{print delay/count}' 
* The answer is 8.01844


2. Revise your solutions to 1abcd to only include flights that took place on the weekends.
* So for the arrive delay only on weekends, we need to put cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{if ($4>5){arrdelay += $15; count += 1}}END{print arrdelay/count}'
* And for the arrive delay, the answer is 5.30331 
* Then for the departure delay only on weekends, we need to put cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{if ($4>5){depdelay += $16; count += 1}}END{print depdelay/count}'
* So the answer for departure delay is 7.55609
* And for the 2005.csv the arrive delay only on weekends, we need to do cat 2005.csv | awk -F, '{if ($4>5){arrdelay += $15; count += 1}}END{print arrdelay/count}'
* And the answer is 4.84079
* Then for the 2005 the departure delay only on weekends, we need to do cat 2005.csv | awk -F, '{if ($4>5){depdelay += $16; count += 1}}END{print depdelay/count}'
* So the answer is 7.51424


3.  Consider the June 2017 taxi cab data, which is located in this folder:


/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018


What is the average distance of a taxi cab ride in New York City in June 2017?
* 2.97862
* Solution: First, We should get into the file, so put cd /depot/statclass/data/taxi2018
* Then we put ls after it
* So we know the file name is yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv
* Then we want to find the line of the distance
* So we put head yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv
* Then we know that the line 5 is the distance
* Then we need to put cat yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv | awk -F, ‘{distance += $5; count += 1}END{print distance/count}’
