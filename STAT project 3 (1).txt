Use R to revisit these questions.  They can each be accomplished with 1 line of code.


1.  As in Project 1, question 2:  In the year 2005, did United or Delta have more flights?
* DL have more flights. DL have 658302 flight and UA have 485918 flights.
* For this question, my code is 
* myDF <- read.csv("/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009/2005.csv")
* head(myDF)
* table(myDF$UniqueCarrier)[c("UA","DL")]


2.  As in Project 2, question 2a:  Restricting attention to weekends (only), what was the average arrival delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?
* 4.939053
* My code for this is 
* mean(myDF$ArrDelay[myDF$DayOfWeek>5], na.rm=T)


3.  As in Project 1, question 3:  In June 2017, what is the distribution of the number of passengers in the taxi cab rides?
* Passenger number

4.  As in Project 2, question 3:   What is the average distance of a taxi cab ride in New York City in June 2017?
* 2.978617
